# Terminal Commands Cheat Sheet

## **Terminal Commands Cheat Sheet: Summary**

Written commands allow actions to be performed within directories more efficiently and powerfully than by using General Operating Systems *i.e.* **GUIs**. 

*N.B.*
- Commands in Terminal are case sensitive. 
- Flags are added with the - symbol and modify Command’s behaviours
- / symbols are used to seperate files within a written file path; *e.g.* BNTA/bnta_work/week_01
- . symbols are used before the stated file type
- In Terminal, Commands take effect once the keyboard's Enter key is pressed after a string of commands is typed into the command line.
